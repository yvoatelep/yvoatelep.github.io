This submission is not completely perfect, but I wanted to submit and hopefully I will return to it later. I did not understand how to connect the gauge chart to the Data that would drop down menu or the data, as 
I did with the other charts. Any direction is appreciated. I also tried to insert an image into the jumbotron, and was unable to make my js work with the css file I created. 
Hopefully that is soemthing I can work on at a later date. Again, any input is appreciated. 

I learned a great deal from this module but it took me a great deal of time to get through it all and I feel I need to move on to the next module and prepare for next week. Thank you.
