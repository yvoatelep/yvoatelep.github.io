This submission is still not completely perfect, but working with a tutor I was able to understand how to connect the gauge chart to the Data filter so that it now changes when a new id is selected. 
Instead of inserting the jumbotron image, which seemed a bit too busy, I went for a background color on one of the other charts as my third element of change on my website. 
I learned a great deal from this module but it took me a great deal of time to get through it all and I feel I need to move on to the next module and prepare for next week. Thank you.
